# CNC Tool Wear

In this Dataset, collected data in machining experiments are given. Machining data was collected from a CNC machine for variations of tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure.

In 18 machining experiments, time series data was collected with a sampling rate of 100 ms from the 4 motors in the CNC (X, Y, Z axes and spindle).
And output of each experiments includes tool condition (unworn and worn tools) and whether or not the tool passed visual inspection.
